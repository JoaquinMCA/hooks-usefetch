# React hooks interview

## Information

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).\
You can do the test on: `https://stackblitz.com/edit/react-ts`\
You can also initiate a new blanck project for the test in your local machine running: `npx create-react-app hooks-usefetch --template typescript`.\
Nevertheless is recomended to start with this repository branch (start-test) for a cleaner setup.

### Objective

The goal of this test is to give an oportunity to the candidate to show knowledge about React hooks and custom hooks displaying the information in: `https://swapi.dev/api/people`\
The stimated time for the test is 20 minutes.

### Available branches

`main`: Contains a more extended solution, retrieving all the information of each person including the lists.\
`basic-solution`: Displais the list and the basic details of each person.\
`start-test`: Contains a blanck project ready to start the test.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
